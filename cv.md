## About Me
My career officially began 14 years ago in a building materials company as a consultant. During this period, I worked in various companies in various managerial and non-managerial positions. Mainly in the IT direction. I am constantly in search of myself, and at some point I realized that the most interesting and varied work, which, in addition to pleasure, allows me to develop in different directions, is software development. I already had some experience with databases and deepened my knowledge in the direction of database development.
Now I think it's time to start learning Front and I plan to become a full stack developer in the future.
